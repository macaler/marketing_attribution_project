# marketing_attribution_project

This is one of several Codecademy Pro guided projects that I completed. The premise is that CoolTShirts, a fictional (to the best of my knowledge) online apparel shop, wants to know which five ad campaigns it should re-invest in. First and last touches of fictional users to the website were aggregated to help arrive at recommendations for the ad campaigns to renew.

I used SQLite to complete this project. Since the fictional data was developed and generated by Codecademy, I cannot include the database that Codecademy provided. However, to give some context to the SQL searches included in this repository, the data base included one data table with columns for page name (which identified a page on the fictional CoolTShirts website), a timestamp of when that page was visited, a user ID, the ad campaign attributed to the click, and the source of that campaign.

I wrote a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation outlining the main results and conclusions of this project; I have included it as "marketing_attribution_project.pdf." The template I used in making the presentation was provided by Codecademy.

Also, a file containing the SQL searches used to gather and analyze the data in this project is provided; it is included as "marketing_attribution_project.sql."
